## TicTacToe

A program that I made for fun during my Winter break from school. This program allows the player
to play against a 'bot.' The bot postion is decided by random numbers generated and verifying
whether the positon is available. A struct is used to hold data for each position on the board, 
the letter (X or O or empty) and a boolean to test whether the spot has yet to be occupied. The
instructions are printed to the console and each successive move is followed by a bot move and a
display of the updated board.
